## Smart City Renewable Energy of Self Simulation

Discrete-Event Simulation could be utilized to solve this problem because it is made up of processes that update once a certain condition has been met (e.g., once a molecule is released or binds with another molecule). Thus, it is a form of state-machine.

To run this simulation, I would manipulate the intensity of the sunlight and the amount of molecules and test how much energy is given off as output. I would also choose different "dosages" of each type of powerhouse and determine if energy released from mitochondria could be reconverted to energy for the photosynthesis process.

Later on, I could also run a smart agent based simulation using plant people as my smart agents and see how this new "lifestyle" would impact one's interactions with their environments.
